        What is the Twitter?    
    </h1>
    <p>
        X, formerly and colloquially known as Twitter, is a social media website based in the United States. With over
        500 million users, it is one of the world's largest social networks. Users can share and post text messages,
        images, and videos known historically as "tweets".[5] X also includes direct messaging, video and audio calling,
        bookmarks, lists and communities, and Spaces, a social audio feature. Users can vote on context added by
        approved users using the Community Notes feature. Although the service is now called X, the primary domain name
        'twitter.com' remains in place as of February 2024, with the 'x.com' URL redirecting to that address.

        The service is owned by the American company X Corp., the successor of Twitter, Inc. Twitter was created in
        March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Noah Glass, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams. It was launched in July of that year.
        Twitter, Inc., was based in San Francisco, California, and had more than 25 offices around the world.[6] A
        signature characteristic of the service was that message posts were required to be brief (originally 140
        characters, later expanded to 280 in 2017). By 2012, more than 100 million users produced 340 million tweets per
        day.[7][8] By the start of 2019, Twitter had more than 330 million monthly active users.[9] The majority of
        tweets is produced by a minority of users.[10][11] In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 48 million
        accounts (15% of all accounts) were not genuine people.[12] As of February 2024, X is the sixth most-visited
        website in the world.[13][14]
